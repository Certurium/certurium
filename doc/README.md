Argentum NT Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Argentum NT Core is the original Argentum NT client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Argentum NT transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Argentum NT Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/bitcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/bitcoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bitcoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Argentum NT Core to your applications folder, and then run Argentum NT Core.
