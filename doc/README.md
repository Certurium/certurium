Certurium Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Certurium Core is the original Certurium client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Certurium transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Certurium Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/bitcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/bitcoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bitcoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Certurium Core to your applications folder, and then run Certurium Core.
